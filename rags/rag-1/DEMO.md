Enter your query: How to do BFS over directed graph

Okay, I can help you understand how to implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a directed graph.

**Core Concept**

BFS explores a graph level by level.  Starting from a source node, it visits all its neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on.  This ensures that nodes closer to the source are visited before nodes farther away.  A que
ue data structure is essential for managing the order of node visits.

**Algorithm for Directed Graphs**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown, along with pseudocode and explanations:

1.  **Initialization:**

    *   `graph`:  A representation of your directed graph (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix).  An adjacency list is generally preferred for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges) as it saves memory.
    *   `start_node`: The node from which you want to start the BFS.
    *   `visited`: A boolean array/set to keep track of visited nodes. Initialize all elements to `false`.  This prevents cycles from causing infinite loops.
    *   `distance`: An array to store the distance from the `start_node` to each node. Initialize all elements to -1 (or infinity) to indicate that no path has been found yet. `distance[start_node]` will be 0.
    *   `queue`: A queue to hold the nodes to be visited.

2.  **Setup:**

    *   Mark `start_node` as visited: `visited[start_node] = true`.
    *   Set the distance to the `start_node` to 0: `distance[start_node] = 0`.
    *   Enqueue the `start_node`: `queue.push(start_node)`.

3.  **Iteration:**

    *   While the `queue` is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node `u` from the front of the `queue`: `u = queue.front(); queue.pop()`.
        *   For each neighbor `v` of node `u` (i.e., for each edge `u -> v`):
            *   If `v` is not visited:
                *   Mark `v` as visited: `visited[v] = true`.
                *   Set the distance to `v`: `distance[v] = distance[u] + 1`.
                *   Enqueue `v`: `queue.push(v)`.

**Pseudocode**

```
function bfs(graph, start_node):
  n = number of nodes in graph
  visited = array of booleans, size n, initialized to false
  distance = array of integers, size n, initialized to -1
  queue = empty queue

  visited[start_node] = true
  distance[start_node] = 0
  queue.push(start_node)

  while queue is not empty:
    u = queue.front()
    queue.pop()

    for v in neighbors(graph, u):  // Iterate through neighbors of u
      if not visited[v]:
        visited[v] = true
        distance[v] = distance[u] + 1
        queue.push(v)

  return distance  // or any other information you want to return
```

**Example (Adjacency List in C++)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m; // n = number of nodes, m = number of edges
  cin >> n >> m;

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n); // Adjacency list: adj[i] stores neighbors of node i

  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v; // Directed edge from u to v
    cin >> u >> v;
    adj[u].push_back(v); // Add v to the adjacency list of u
  }

  int start_node;
  cin >> start_node;

  vector<int> distance(n, -1);
  vector<bool> visited(n, false);
  queue<int> q;

  visited[start_node] = true;
  distance[start_node] = 0;
  q.push(start_node);

  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();

    for (int v : adj[u]) {
      if (!visited[v]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        distance[v] = distance[u] + 1;
        q.push(v);
      }
    }
  }

  // Print the distances from the start node
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << "Distance from " << start_node << " to " << i << ": " << distance[i] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the C++ Code:**

*   **Adjacency List:** `vector<vector<int>> adj(n)` represents the graph. `adj[i]` is a vector containing all the nodes that are directly reachable from node `i`.
*   **Input:** The code first takes the number of nodes (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the edges themselves as input.  It then takes the `start_node` as input.
*   **BFS Implementation:** The `while` loop implements the BFS algorithm as described in the pseudocode.
*   **Output:** Finally, the code prints the calculated distances from the `start_node` to all other nodes in the graph.

**Time and Space Complexity**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  This is because each vertex and each edge are visited at most once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(V) in the worst case, as the queue might contain all the vertices in the graph.  The `visited` and `distance` arrays also take O(V) space.

**Key Considerations for Competitive Programming**

*   **Graph Representation:**  Choose the appropriate graph representation (adjacency list or adjacency matrix) based on the graph's density. Adjacency lists are usually better for sparse graphs.
*   **Zero-based vs. One-based Indexing:** Be mindful of whether the problem uses zero-based or one-based indexing for nodes and adjust your code accordingly.  The example above uses zero-based indexing.
*   **Large Graphs:** For very large graphs, be careful about memory usage.  Consider using more memory-efficient data structures if necessary.
*   **Edge Weights:**  Standard BFS finds the shortest path in terms of the *number* of edges. If you have a weighted graph (where edges have different costs), you'll need to use Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm instead
.  BFS, in its standard form, assumes all edge weights are equal to 1.
*   **Disconnected Graphs:**  If the graph is disconnected, a single BFS call will only explore the connected component containing the `start_node`. To visit all nodes, you might need to iterate through all nodes and start a BFS from eac
h unvisited node.
